## How to run the script
You cannot directly “run” a Python script from GitHub just by visiting its URL — GitHub only stores the file.
To execute it, you need to download/clone it locally or use a service that can fetch and run it.
Here are the main ways:

1. Run Locally After Cloning
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SahilKumar777/Python-Scripts.git
# Go into the repo folder
cd Python-Scripts/Assignment_GET_API

# Run the Python script
python3 fetch_user_data.py

✅ Works offline after cloning.
⚠ Requires Python installed locally.

2. Run Directly Without Cloning (via curl/wget)
You can fetch the raw file and pipe it to Python:
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SahilKumar777/Python-Scripts/refs/heads/main/Assignment_GET_API/fetch_user_data.py | python3

Or:
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SahilKumar777/Python-Scripts/refs/heads/main/Assignment_GET_API/fetch_user_data.py | python3

✅ Quick one-liner.
⚠ No caching — downloads every time.

3. Run in Google Colab (No Local Setup)

Go to Google Colab.
Click File → Open Notebook → GitHub.
Paste the repo URL and open the .py or .ipynb file.
Run cells in the browser.

✅ No installation needed.
⚠ Requires internet.

4. Run Automatically with GitHub Actions
If you want the script to run on GitHub’s servers (e.g., on push or schedule):
.github/workflows/run-script.yml
name: Run Python Script

on:
  workflow_dispatch:  # Manual trigger
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * *"  # Every day at midnight UTC

jobs:
  run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.x'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Run script
        run: python script_name.py

✅ Runs in the cloud automatically.
⚠ Cannot interact with your local machine.

5. Run in Replit or Other Online IDEs

Import the GitHub repo into Replit.
Click Run.

✅ Browser-based, no setup.
⚠ Limited resources.

💡 Recommendation:
If you just want to quickly execute a Python script from GitHub without cloning, method #2 is fastest.
If you want it to run automatically on a schedule, use GitHub Actions.

If you want, I can give you a ready-to-use GitHub Actions workflow that runs your Python script daily and emails you the output.
Do you want me to prepare that?
